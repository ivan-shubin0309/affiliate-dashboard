As can see the system is rather basic, with around 20 screens, and should have a clean simple look

We want to convert the design to Figma, modernize and improve it

**MUST OF VERY GOOD ENGLISH COMMUNICATION SKILLS**  

## Scope
- Convert XD design to Figma, follow exact guideline bellow
- Interview with stakeholders (1) and understand needs and inspiration for the system
- Suggests improvements to design and go through feedback and refinement process
- Complete design of missing part
- Prepare for developer handoff 
- Follow development process, help, make adjustment as needed, confirm results fit the design
- Do manual testing to make sure developed system fit match the old in functionality and correctness and fit the new design 

## Design Guidelines
- Use Chakra UI Figma Kit as base, we are going to use React Chakra-UI component library and this will help when moving the design to code
