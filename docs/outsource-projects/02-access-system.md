### Database
to connect to database 

create ./app/.env
ask for the content, include env variable to connect to database

### can also import locally from sql dump file 

from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1do_egfrSgnYCgpqr10b5yH6aKFM7JXUY/view?usp=share_link 

### PHP code

We need to translate all the PHP code under

`https://github.com/affiliatets-com/FocusOption/tree/main/site/affiliate`

Some already converted, see 

`app/src/server/api/routers/affiliates`

## Notes

- We use prettier for code formatting, make sure to configure your IDE
to reformat on save for best DX
- when push to main code automaticly deploy to netlify  
`https://affiliate-com.netlify.app/`
- I managed to run PHP version locally and log SQL queries done using docker
let me know if you need this and I can help (need to have docker)
