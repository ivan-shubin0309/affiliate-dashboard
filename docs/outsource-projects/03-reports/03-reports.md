### Software stack
- MySQL - Same and shard with  legacy PHP database, cannot change
- NodeJS
- Prisma - ORM
- TypeScript
- TRPC for API
- React, client side code

### Experience Needed
- PHP - To read existing code
- NodeJS
- MySQL
- Prisma - Most of the work is to convert SQL queries to prisma API
- TypeScript

### Scope

The main work is to convert the SQL queries from PHP code to prisma

example Prisma code: `app/src/server/api/routers/affiliates/creative.ts`

The React UI is rather basic grid for all reports

### Code

  `app/prisma/schema.prisma`

- existing prisma call to query MySQL and implement TRPC API
  `app/src/server/api/routers/affiliates`

- React components to show existing screens
  `app/src/components/affiliates`
